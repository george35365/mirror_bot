- Move that file to the root of mirror-bot, and rename it to credentials.json
- Visit [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)
- Search for Drive and enable it if it is disabled
- Finally, run the script to generate token file (token.pickle) for Google Drive:
```
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
python3 generate_drive_token.py
```

# Deploying On Heroku :-
#Deploying on Heroku
- First Run Bot locally on your computer i.e: Do above steps and get G-Drive Token File( token.pickle )
- Change Bot Download Dir to /bot/downloads in config.ini file.
- Install [Heroku cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
- Login into your heroku account with command:
```
heroku login
```
- Create a new heroku app:
```
heroku create appname	
```
- Select This App in your Heroku-cli: 
```
heroku git:remote -a appname
```
- Change Dyno Stack to a Docker Container:
```
heroku stack:set container
```
- Add Private Credentials and Config Stuff:
```
git add . --force
```
- Commit new changes:
```
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
```
- Push Code to Heroku:
```
git push heroku master --force
```
- Restart Worker by these commands:
```
heroku ps:scale worker=0
```
```
heroku ps:scale worker=1	
```

Heroku-Note: Doing authorizations ( /authorize command ) through telegram wont be permanent as heroku uses ephemeral filesystem. They will be reset on each dyno boot.

# Youtube-dl authentication using .netrc file
For using your premium accounts in youtube-dl, edit the netrc file (in the root directory of this repository) according to following format:
